## 10/9/2025 - got the power rails and buck converters roughly figured out  

got started with the power stuff today because that felt like a good anchor
opened up a blank KiCad sheet and just kinda sat there before committing to the first buck converter
threw in a couple AP62300s, added some random caps that looked about right
did basic power rails like +3.3VA and +5V, mostly by guessing current draw
honestly spent more time figuring out resistor values than placing parts
it's still super rough, but at least the boardâ€™s not completely empty anymore
definitely not thinking about routing yet![day 1.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTIzMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4c5f583684176dfbddac1a05d51663791643253a/day%201.png)
