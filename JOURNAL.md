## 10/9/2025 - got the power rails and buck converters roughly figured out  

got started with the power stuff today because that felt like a good anchor
opened up a blank KiCad sheet and just kinda sat there before committing to the first buck converter
threw in a couple AP62300s, added some random caps that looked about right
did basic power rails like +3.3VA and +5V, mostly by guessing current draw
honestly spent more time figuring out resistor values than placing parts
it's still super rough, but at least the board’s not completely empty anymore
definitely not thinking about routing yet![day 1.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTIzMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4c5f583684176dfbddac1a05d51663791643253a/day%201.png)
  

## 10/10/2025 - threw in the hdmi stuff  

dove headfirst into HDMI today and instantly regretted it!
the connector footprint was cursed and I had to double-check every diff pair
wired up the HDMI chip and some tiny filter caps for signal integrity
had to decide whether to bother with hotplug detection and i just YOLO’d it in
tried to keep traces as short as possible even though I haven’t routed anything
also added pull-ups and random ESD protection that I may or may not actually populate
got through it alive, but just barely

## 10/11/2025 1:00 AM - added the cm4 lite footprint and some essentials around it  

today was CM4 Lite day, and man this thing has a crazy number of pins
literally had to scroll through three different PDFs to not mess up the IO mapping
figured out where to connect PCIe and eMMC signals even though I’m not using either
started drawing out the main headers and labeling them so I wouldn’t cry later
threw in level shifters and testpoints just to be safe![day3.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTQ4NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--efd85f72346e42830c84962ea838c18fade0c178/day3.png)
  

## 10/11/2025 1:02 AM - hooked up the esp and usb hub chip  

today was about the esp32 and the USB hub, two chips I really like but hate wiring
added the esp32 footprint and spent too long assigning IOs
for the usb hub, I was constantly bouncing between the datasheet and KiCad
wired up USB upstream/downstream lines and crossed my fingers on signal integrity
threw in some debug headers and left room for ESD stuff I haven’t decided on yet
also started routing logic enable signals to give me more control later
kinda messy but functionally complete![day4.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTQ4NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fd94e24be29d5c38b869675385ff19243a17c339/day4.png)
  

## 10/11/2025 8 PM - the gpio, ethernet, sd signals etc., are getting crowded  

this was cleanup day, had to declutter a lot of overlapping nets
focused on GPIO and voltage domains because things were starting to get scary
double checked voltage levels everywhere and pulled back any accidental 5V hits
renamed nets to stuff like USB_D+ and PWR_BTN so I don’t get lost later
added a few jumpers where I needed config flexibility![gpio.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTYxMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f982bf6c752e0e6e82c77e3ed0b15de5d7ac2dd7/gpio.png)
  

## 10/12/2025 8 AM - added a bunch of buttons, switches, and gpio expands  

felt like expanding the UI side today, so buttons and switches got added
dropped in an IO expander to control all the random toggles I want
added RGB LED, backlight control, and the mandatory cyberpunk toggle
also threw in debug pads and labeled everything just in case I forget stuff later
double checked how the esp talks to the neopixel![buttons.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTc0MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--bea606db09a49f9c9629447154d89016010342b1/buttons.png)
  

## 10/12/2025 9:38 AM - threw in the power switch logic  

focused entirely on the battery and power switch logic today
added charging ICs, battery monitor, and some MOSFET magic for switching
realized I forgot to add thermistor protection, so threw that in last minute
checked current sense resistor values like 5 times because battery fires aren’t cool
rewired the main power path so everything’s a bit safer
design is power-heavy now but kinda elegant
will probably still debug it with a fire extinguisher nearby![power switch.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTc0NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e7bb61ba90cab78b7df135d8d4a798329d68e11c/power%20switch.png)
  

## 10/12/2025 9:40 AM - general cleanup and better power domain separation  

long session , mostly organizing the whole schematic properly
split things into hierarchy sheets because the top level was getting out of control
reassigned power domains and labeled them to make layout cleaner later
caught a bunch of dumb mistakes like misnamed nets and flipped diodes
also started writing notes inside schematic blocks to help future-me
deleted some sketchy looking wires and redrew for clarity
design now feels like an actual engineering thing and not a spaghetti nightmare![cleanup.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTc0NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--d0735bf9bcca186518cf2607a27d0dadca2b5570/cleanup.png)
  

## 10/13/2025 8:03 PM - display interface is finally somewhat sane	  

this one was about the screen and making sure it won’t fry
hooked up the LCD interface and added ESD resistors on all the touch lines
tried to keep traces short even though I’m still in schematic mode
double checked the display’s backlight, touchscreen, and data lines
added a debug header just to probe signals later if things don’t work
organized the connector pins to make layout easier
this part was clean.![blueprint stuff.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjAwMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--de6eac190f84afec7f4474a248ebf7cebad02246/blueprint%20stuff.png)
  

## 10/13/2025 8:05 PM - finished the display PCB design, it’s looking clean and mini  

started work on the display PCB and honestly this one's way calmer than the main board
got the basic stuff in first power input, the FPC connector for the screen, and some random passives
had to rotate the layout like 3 times to make the FPC orientation make sense
added pull-up resistors.![display pcb doneee.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjAwMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b987bba5993dd67100762fb9fdcc1a27fcc8db02/display%20pcb%20doneee.png)
