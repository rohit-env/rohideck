## 10/9/2025 - got the power rails and buck converters roughly figured out  

got started with the power stuff today because that felt like a good anchor
opened up a blank KiCad sheet and just kinda sat there before committing to the first buck converter
threw in a couple AP62300s, added some random caps that looked about right
did basic power rails like +3.3VA and +5V, mostly by guessing current draw
honestly spent more time figuring out resistor values than placing parts
it's still super rough, but at least the board’s not completely empty anymore
definitely not thinking about routing yet![day 1.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTIzMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4c5f583684176dfbddac1a05d51663791643253a/day%201.png)
  

## 10/10/2025 - threw in the hdmi stuff  

dove headfirst into HDMI today and instantly regretted it!
the connector footprint was cursed and I had to double-check every diff pair
wired up the HDMI chip and some tiny filter caps for signal integrity
had to decide whether to bother with hotplug detection and i just YOLO’d it in
tried to keep traces as short as possible even though I haven’t routed anything
also added pull-ups and random ESD protection that I may or may not actually populate
got through it alive, but just barely

## 10/11/2025 - added the cm4 lite footprint and some essentials around it  

today was CM4 Lite day, and man this thing has a crazy number of pins
literally had to scroll through three different PDFs to not mess up the IO mapping
figured out where to connect PCIe and eMMC signals even though I’m not using either
started drawing out the main headers and labeling them so I wouldn’t cry later
threw in level shifters and testpoints just to be safe![day3.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTQ4NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--efd85f72346e42830c84962ea838c18fade0c178/day3.png)
